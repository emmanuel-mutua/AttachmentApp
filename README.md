# Modularisation
- Helps structure code in a way that is improves maintainability and helps avoid these problems
- Help improve scalability, readability, code quality
- So important for growing projects, scalable projects
- Split project into parts where each part is independent 
- Each feature has its own module
- Benefits : Code reuse via code sharing
- Visibility control, expose some parts (promotions)
- Customizable delivery
- Testability
- Build Time - Improves build performance
- Used to enforce accountability 
- Easy manage
- Encapsulation (Isolated code - A module has no knowledge of what other module is used)

# Module Types
- Understand:
- Modularization helps in organizing codebase in a loosely coupled and self contained parts
- **Low coupling** -> Module should be as independent as possible from one another (self contained parts)
- **High cohesion** -> Module should contain a code that acts like a system

- Read modularisation: On documentation : Link :https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization

- **First define version catalog** - _It will act as a single source of truth for all the dependencies_
- It means all the versions and dependencies used in the project
